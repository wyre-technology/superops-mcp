/**
 * Per-request MCP Server reference for elicitation support.
 *
 * Avoids circular imports by decoupling the server instance from domain
 * handlers, without leaking that reference across concurrent requests.
 *
 * SECURITY (cross-tenant misroute): this used to be a module-level
 * `let _server` singleton, set synchronously per request via `setServerRef`
 * and read back later via `getServerRef` — including after `await` gaps
 * inside async tool handlers (e.g. after awaiting a SuperOps API call,
 * before sending an elicitation/confirmation prompt back through "the"
 * server).
 *
 * In gateway (multi-tenant HTTP) mode a fresh `Server` is created per
 * request, so two concurrent requests race through that shared global:
 * tenant A's request sets the ref and starts awaiting async work; before A
 * resumes, tenant B's request runs and overwrites the module-level ref with
 * B's server/transport; when A's awaited work resolves and it reads the ref
 * back to call `elicitInput`, it gets B's server and A's confirmation prompt
 * is sent down B's connection instead of A's.
 *
 * Fixed by binding the server reference to an AsyncLocalStorage context
 * instead of a shared mutable variable. ALS scopes the value to the async
 * call graph it was entered from, and correctly restores it after arbitrary
 * `await` gaps, so concurrent requests can never observe each other's
 * server — mirroring the existing per-request credential isolation in
 * `client.ts` (`credentialStore` / `runWithCredentials`).
 *
 * There is intentionally no module-level mutable server/transport state in
 * this file.
